			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>
				COVID-19 has spread throughout a large amount of countries throughout the world, including Canada.
				Governments must act quickly and take into consideration the effects of factors such as social distancing.
				This website provides a free simulation model, which offers insightful data about the propagation of the virus.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the Licensed Internet Technicians Fabian And Maxence (LITFAM)'s COVID Bubble Simulation,
				people are represented as bubbles inside a container. Certain bubbles are infected at the beginning, 
				and when they touch another bubble, they transmit the virus. The number of sick bubbles, 
				and the amount of time it takes to reach total infection, is tracked in real time.
			</p>
			<p>
				Three types of people are tracked:
				<ul>
					<li>Those who are healthy</li>
					<li>Those who are sick</li>
					<li>Those who were sick, but have recovered (immune)</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				The following factors can also be modified:
				<ul>
					<li>Size of the container</li>
					<li>Radius of the bubbles</li>
					<li>Number of bubbles</li>
					<li>Number of static (fixed) bubbles</li>
					<li>Initial ratio of sick to healthy bubbles</li>
					<li>Speed of the bubbles</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				The website is intended for formal use by international government agencies.
				We encourage these agencies to refer to our website to predict COVID-19 trends.
